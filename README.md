![License: MIT ](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

I refactored an e-commerce platform given as a task in a bootcamp coding course, so that it uses Redux.
 
I learn:  
    - how to how to manage global state using Reactâ€™s Context API.     
    - how to use React components, manage application state, and pass data throughout your app.     
    - how to use React Router to add dynamic client-side routing to apps.  
    - how to Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server..    
    - how deploy to Render with a connection to a Database.    
    - how to use Vite.
