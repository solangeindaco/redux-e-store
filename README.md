# GraphQL Book Search Engine

![License: MIT ](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server as part of a bootcamp coding course.
 
I learn:  
    - how to create a single-page application (SPA) using React.     
    - how to use React components, manage application state, and pass data throughout your app.     
    - how to use React Router to add dynamic client-side routing to apps.  
    - how to Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server..    
    - how deploy to Render.    
    - how to use Vite.

## Installation

Repository URL: https://github.com/solangeindaco/graphql-book-search-eng   
Deployed application: https://graphql-book-search-eng.onrender.com/   

## Usage

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

![Animation shows "star wars" typed into a search box and books about Star Wars appearing as results.](./assets/21-mern-homework-demo-01.gif)

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

![Animation shows user clicking "Save This Book!" button to save books that appear in search results. The button label changes to "Book Already Saved" after it is clicked and the book is saved.](./assets/21-mern-homework-demo-02.gif)

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:
